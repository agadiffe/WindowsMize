## üìö Usage
This script requires 'PowerShell 7 (aka PowerShell Core)' and must be run as Administrator.  
It's recommended to use Notepad++ or VSCode to have the code highlighted.

### Automated
1. Open a PowerShell prompt (Administrator privileges are not required).  
   Right-click on `Start Menu` > `Terminal`.
2. Download and extract WindowsMize archive to the 'Downloads' folder.  
   e.g. `C:\Users\<User>\Downloads\WindowsMize`.  
   If the folder 'WindowsMize' exist, it will be deleted.  
   Save any data you want to keep (e.g. previous configuration and/or log files).
    ```powershell
    irm 'https://github.com/agadiffe/WindowsMize/raw/main/tools/Download_WindowsMize.ps1' | iex
    ```
3. Navigate to the extracted 'WindowsMize' folder in your 'Downloads' folder.
4. **Configure the script (WindowsMize.ps1) according to your preferences**.
5. Double click on the `Run_WindowsMize.cmd` file to run the script.  
   Accept the Windows UAC prompt to run it as Administrator (required).  
   If 'PowerShell 7' is not installed, it will be automatically installed.
6. Restart (Mandatory for a lot of tweaks/settings).
